145,Zapdos,1,90,90,85,125,90,100,"Zapdos is a large, avian Pokémon with predominantly yellow plumage. It has small, triangular eyes with black around them and a long, thin, light orange beak. Its wings and tail are a mass of spiky feathers and there are black feathers covering the back of its wings and inner tail feathers. A large crest of spiked feathers surrounds its head. Its thighs are tan, and it has thin, light orange legs. It has feet with three forward-facing toes and one backward-facing toe; each toe has a short talon. Rarely seen , in An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS , Zapdos is said to be a divine bird that presides over the heavens, spending millennia among thunderclouds, before descending with lightning bolts. When Zapdos flaps its glittering wings, it releases electricity that can potentially cause thunderstorms. Naturally, it produces massive crackling and snapping sounds when it flies; these are attributed to the lightning bolts it sheds when airborne. Zapdos reportedly appears only during thunderstorms and gains power when struck by lightning. When attacking, Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards shows that Zapdos can electrify its talons. In The Power of One , Zapdos is said to regulate the ocean's currents, and when captured, they become catastrophically unstable. It is also shown to communicate with other Electric-type Pokémon through exchanging lightning bolts. Furthermore, it is exceptionally territorial, immediately conquering and terraforming Fire Island after Moltres is captured in the interests of controlling the Orange Islands with thunder. It is said to be capable of defeating a lone Lugia when battling alongside Articuno and Moltres . As seen in Pokémon Horizons , like other Legendary Pokémon , Zapdos can be found in the Pokémon paradise Laqua . Zapdos loves Zapdos Treats made by Snacksworth , who once saw it fly right by him in the past.",
64,Kadabra,1,40,35,30,120,70,105,"Kadabra is a primarily yellow, slightly humanoid Pokémon with mammalian features. It has two long, pointed ears on top of its head, a red star on its forehead, narrow, deep-set eyes, and wide cheeks leading down to a thin snout. Extending from each side of its snout are two mustache-like tufts of fur; a male will have a longer mustache than a female. Kadabra's torso is segmented with bulky shoulders, a thick, brown chest, and a small abdomen marked by three red, wavy lines. Attached to the Pokémon's abdomen is a large, thick tail encircled with a brown band near its base. Its arms are thin with brown elbows and end in three-fingered hands with white claws. Its legs have prominent knees and large, three-toed feet, also ending in white claws. Two of its toes face forward and one backward. Kadabra is always seen carrying a silver spoon, which amplifies its telekinetic powers. A gold spoon does not work as an amplifier and Kadabra is only half as strong without a spoon. Kadabra emits alpha waves strong enough to induce headaches, and can even cause clocks to run backward, machines to malfunction, and delicate devices to cease functioning altogether. The waves increase further in strength the more danger Kadabra faces. By closing its eyes, it can double the number of alpha particles it emits. When it has a headache, the alpha waves become unusual. All of Kadabra's brain cells work in unison while it uses its powers. It sleeps while levitating, using its springy tail like a pillow. It can store up psychic energy inside its star in preparation for its Evolution. There is a theory that Kadabra was born from a transformed human child who could not control his powers. Kadabra lives in urban areas . Kadabra and its evolved form, Alakazam , are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Kinesis .",Kadabra evolves from Abra and evolves into Alakazam .
83,Farfetch'd,1,52,65,55,58,62,60,"Farfetch'd is an avian Pokémon that resembles a light brown duck with a white underbelly. It has a flat, yellow beak, brown eyes, a V-shaped black marking on its forehead (similar to a unibrow ), and a three-feather crest on top of its head. Its wings are as big as its body and appear to be prehensile enough to substitute for hands. It has yellow legs with webbed feet and a stubby tail. Farfetch'd is always seen carrying a leek stalk or spring onion. It carries this sprig in its wings, but sometimes chooses to hold it in its beak or feet instead. Unable to live without its stick, Farfetch'd will defend it with its life. Losing the stalk can leave Farfetch'd defenseless, and it will seek out a new one to replace it. Known uses for the stick include use as a weapon, nesting material, and emergency food source. When using the stalk to attack, Farfetch'd wields and uses it like a sword to cut through things. There are several different fighting styles involving Farfetch'd's leek. It is selective about which sticks it will use and has been known to fight over good ones. As mentioned in Sleep Style Dex , Farfetch'd will always hold onto its stalk, even when sleeping on its back in a defenseless position. Farfetch'd has four different sleep styles it sleeps in: Sprawled Sleep , Plant-Stalk-at-the-Ready Sleep , Plant-Stalk-Nibbling Sleep , and Atop-Belly Sleep . Farfetch'd is found in temperate grasslands where reedy plants grow, guarding the plants from anyone trying to disturb them. However, Farfetch'd is rarely seen, and thus it is thought that its numbers are decreasing, and that it is at risk of extinction. According to sources such as Pokémon the Series and the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia , its population decline is caused by humans who hunted it down for food ; one popular recipe suggested cooking it with its own leek. There have been attempts at breeding in order to increase the Farfetch'd population. In the Pikachu short Pikachu's Vacation , Farfetch'd are shown to be able to swim like real-life ducks.",Galarian Farfetch'd evolves into Sirfetch'd . Kantonian Farfetch'd is not known to evolve.
138,Omanyte,1,35,40,100,90,55,35,"Omanyte is a small extinct cephalopod mollusk Pokémon similar to an ammonite or nautilus . It has a sky blue body with ten tentacles and a pale yellow, helix-spiraled shell on its back. The shell's rim has two circular indents where Omanyte's large saucer-like eyes protrude. If attacked or threatened, it quickly withdraws into its hard shell. Omanyte is considered extinct, although it can be revived from fossils . Its fossils have been excavated in areas that were once oceans long ago. Omanyte regulated its buoyancy by storing and releasing air within its shell and controlled direction by twisting its tentacles. While Omanyte fed on plankton , it was preyed on by Archeops and Carracosta . Omanyte can now be found in the wild due to being released by people or escaping after being restored to life, causing this species to become a problem.",Omanyte evolves into Omastar .
90,Shellder,1,30,65,100,45,25,40,"Shellder is a bivalve mollusk Pokémon encased within a spiky, blue-violet bivalve shell. It has two round white eyes with tiny black pupils. Its long, red tongue, usually hidden due to the darkness of Shellder’s body, extends from its often closed mouth. Shellder uses this tongue to burrow into the sand to sleep overnight and to lure and capture prey. If it were to close its shell, nothing could come to it; however, the tongue protrudes even when its shell is shut. Tugging on it will cause the shell to pop open. Its soft and tender body is well-protected by its extremely durable shell, which is purported to be harder than diamonds and has historically been used by people to make shields. It can make pearls from accumulated sand, though it discards them as they are typically in its way. Shellder has an unusually strong appetite for the tail of a Slowpoke and can develop a symbiotic relationship with the Dopey Pokémon. After attaching itself to the Slowpoke's tail, the two undergo a metamorphosis and evolve into Slowbro together. Alternatively, if it attaches to the head of a Slowpoke in possession of a King's Rock , the two will instead evolve into Slowking . These relationships allow it to travel onto land and begin a new stage in its life cycle. In Galar , Shellder attaches to the forearms and heads of Galarian Slowpoke wearing Galarica Cuffs or Galarica Wreaths , causing the Evolution into Galarian Slowbro and Galarian Slowking, respectively. Shellder that are part of Slowbro change in shape further if it Mega Evolves. Regardless of which form the two Pokémon evolve into, Shellder's shell changes to a light gray color with irregular darker spots. Its shape changes into a spiny, spiraled cone with several tiers, which is slightly rounded for Galarian Slowbro. Sharp teeth develop around the rim of the shell to anchor it securely to the evolved Slowpoke, and its eyes now peek out from the bottom rim of the shell. In its crown form, Shellder has a large horn on either side of its shell, which is purple for Galarian Slowking. It also gains a gem: a red one on the underside for Johtonian Slowking, and a green one between its eyes for the Galarian form. As part of Mega Slowbro, it becomes large enough to contain most of the Slowpoke's body, gaining two holes near the rim and an opening at the tip, through which protrude the Slowpoke's forelegs and tail respectively.",Shellder evolves into Cloyster .
69,Bellsprout,1,50,75,35,70,30,40,"Bellsprout is a plant -based Pokémon with a stem-like brown body. There is a single green leaf on each side of its body. It has a yellow bell-shaped head with what appear to be pink lips at the end and beady black eyes. It is capable of spitting corrosive acid from its mouth. Its stem is long, thin and very flexible, making it capable of swerving rapidly to avoid many attacks or moving with blinding speed to capture prey. Its roots resemble feet, and it uses them as such. It will plant its roots in the ground to replenish water, but it is unable to flee while it is rooted. Bellsprout prefers hot and humid places, thus it lives in temperate forests and jungles . As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Bellsprout is known to sleep while planting its roots deep in the ground.Because Bellsprout feels so safe while sleeping, it tends to forget that it may need to run from danger.","Bellsprout evolves into Weepinbell , which evolves into Victreebel ."
133,Eevee,1,55,55,50,45,65,55,"Eevee is a small, mammalian , quadrupedal Pokémon with primarily brown fur. The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored. It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot. Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears with dark brown interiors, and a small black nose. Eevee has an unstable and irregularly shaped genetic structure that causes it to mutate when exposed to the radiation of Evolution stones . Its DNA is easily influenced by its environment, which allows it to suddenly and perfectly adapt to harsh habitats by evolving into one of eight different Pokémon . The reason why only Eevee has such unusual genes, which are the key to solving the mysteries of Evolution, remains unknown. Even its face can end up becoming similar to that of its Trainer . Eevee is an extremely rare Pokémon mostly found in cities and towns . In Pokémon Sleep , it is suggested that it dreams about which form it will evolve into in the future. Eevee is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Extreme Evoboost .",Eevee can evolve into eight different Pokémon (collectively called Eeveelutions ).
135,Jolteon,1,65,65,60,110,95,130,"Jolteon is a quadrupedal, mammalian Pokémon . It is covered in yellow fur with a spiky fringe around its tail and a white ruff around its neck. Its ears are large and pointed with black interiors, and its eyes and small nose are black. It has slender legs and small paws, each with three toes and a pink paw-pad. Jolteon's lungs contain an organ that produces electrical energy, causing a crackling sound to be heard when it exhales. This sound can also be heard during its slumber, as mentioned in Pokémon Sleep .When angered or startled, Jolteon bristles its fur in battle , causing each strand to stiffen into sharp, needle-like quills that can pierce enemies. It then finishes them off by blasting wicked 10,000-volt thunderbolts, which are generated either by gathering negative ions from the atmosphere or by concentrating the weak electrical charge emitted by its cells. This charge is amplified by the static electricity within its fur, which consists of electrically charged needles. When Jolteon becomes energized, these needles stand on end and harden, signaling that it is about to unleash its power. The charge is so potent that shed quills can retain electricity for a long time. Jolteon's fur also produces a constant sparking noise due to the negative ions it generates. Additionally, when agitated, it can straighten and fire small numbers of these electrically charged quills like a missile barrage . Lightning is known to sometimes strike next to it. It is a sensitive Pokémon who easily feels sad or angry, so it charges power whenever its mood changes. Because of its high-strung nature, Jolteon can be difficult for Pokémon Trainers to grow close to it. It is most often found in cities and towns under the ownership of Trainers.",Jolteon evolves from Eevee .
97,Hypno,1,85,73,70,73,115,67,"Hypno is a bipedal, slightly humanoid Pokémon that has yellow skin. It has triangular ears with brown interiors, sleepy-looking eyes, and a large nose. On its neck, it has a ruff of white fur, which is longer on the female. Hypno has five fingers on each hand and holds a pendulum in its left. The pendulum resembles a flat, silver ring and is used for hypnotism. Hypno is never seen without it. It has three toes on each foot, which also have a pink pad on the undersides. Hypno is able to put people to sleep by swinging its pendulum. It is known to reside away from humans and on less-traveled roads . While it awaits its prey, it polishes its pendulum. If anyone comes by, Hypno will hypnotize them and eat their dreams. It carries away people having good dreams and is even known to have stolen a child at one point. However, in the Alola region , it preys primarily on Komala , and cases of Hypno targeting humans are notably rare. Some Hypno are even known to assist doctors in hospitals when their patients cannot sleep at night. In the Trainers' School in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon , a Hypno is shown to be capable of creating illusions, namely by disguising itself as a human and causing illusory children to appear. As shown in Battling Besties! , Hypno is left feeling completely despondent if its pendulum gets damaged in any way.",Hypno evolves from Drowzee .
86,Seel,1,65,45,55,45,70,45,"Seel is a pinniped Pokémon with a thick hide covered in bluish-white fur. It has a pale tan canine maw with a large red tongue and a pair of tusks on its lower jaw. It has circular eyes, prominent black eyebrows (it’s one of the few Pokémon that has eyebrows) and a black nose that is capable of closing when it swims. There is a small horn on its forehead, which it uses in combination with its tusks to bore through ice floes. It has two flippers on its chest, and two more on the end of its tail. When the tail is raised, it resembles a waterspout. Seel lives on icebergs in frigid ocean waters. Its warm fur and thick hide allow it to swim in waters as cold as −40° Fahrenheit (−40° Celsius). It thrives in these cold environments, becoming more active as the temperature drops and tires easily in warm waters. Preferring to sleep during the day, it hunts for prey under sheets of ice in the late day and evening hours. While it is a graceful swimmer, it is awkward and struggles to move on dry land.",Seel evolves into Dewgong .
41,Zubat,1,40,45,35,30,40,55,"Zubat is a blue, chiropteran Pokémon . While it lacks eyes, it has pointed ears with purple insides and a mouth with two sharp teeth on each jaw. A male will have larger fangs than a female. It has purple wing membranes supported by two elongated fingers and two long, thin legs without feet. Zubat lives in abundance in dark caves , although it has also been known to dwell in forests and under the eaves of old buildings. Due to its habitat, Zubat has evolved to have neither eyes nor nostrils. It instead navigates through dark environments and tight caves with echolocation , emitting ultrasonic cries to detect targets and obstacles. The frequency of these cries can vary slightly between Zubat colonies. As demonstrated in the Pokémon the Series episode Clefairy and the Moon Stone , it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat to seek prey. Zubat is nocturnal and sleeps hanging upside down during the daytime, avoiding sunlight at all costs. Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy; prolonged exposure can even burn its skin. However, captured and trained Zubat have been recorded as much more tenacious in the daytime, even when directly exposed to sunbeams. While sleeping, or in colder conditions, Zubat gathers for warmth with others of its kind.","Zubat evolves into Golbat , which evolves into Crobat ."
75,Graveler,1,55,95,115,45,45,35,"Graveler is a bipedal, boulder Pokémon . Its round body is covered with small bumps and it has a rocky crest above its small eyes and mouth. It has four arms, each with a three-fingered hand. Its second pair of arms is typically kept tucked against its chest. It was shown in Pokémon Snap that, despite having legs, it can revert to a legless form. This grants it the ability to float. Graveler's preferred locomotion is rolling, as it is a slow walker. It often rolls down mountain paths at high speeds exceeding 60 mph (96.56 km/h), crushing objects in the way and stopping by running into huge rocks should it build up too much speed. It does not pay attention to obstacles, so it may potentially harm hikers as it rolls. However, it will explode if it rolls into a river. Graveler is known to be generally free and uncaring, not minding if pieces of itself break off since they can regrow over time. It climbs a mountain from base to summit, feasting on rocks all the while. Graveler's favorite food is moss-covered rocks, regularly consumming tons of them and making loud noises while eating. Upon reaching the peak, it rolls down to the bottom. Graveler live in horizontal holes that they gouge out in sheer cliff faces , and they are capable of withstanding volcanic temperatures. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Graveler is known to rock back and forth while sleeping. It is believed that it dreams about rolling down hilly paths.",Graveler evolves from Geodude and evolves into Golem .
82,Magneton,1,50,60,95,120,70,70,"Magneton is a robot-like Pokémon , the result of three Magnemite becoming linked together by a strong magnetic force, although a single Magnemite can evolve by itself when there are no other Magnemite in the vicinity. Each individual Magnemite has a gray spherical body with a single eye, and a gray and red-and-blue tipped horseshoe magnet on each side. The topmost Magnemite has three Phillips head screws on its body, while the others appear to have only two. The three Magnemite that Magneton consists of can be linked in several ways. Magneton is most commonly seen as one Magnemite on top, and two Magnemite linked by the screws on the bottom, forming a triangle. In some cases, commonly seen in 3D games such as Pokémon Snap , the Magnemite will not be connected at all, remain in a triangular formation at rest, and are able to freely move within each other's vicinity to form other patterns. In this case, all three Magnemite have three screws. The magnetic forces that hold the three Magnemite together are powerful enough to dry up all moisture and raise the temperature by 3.6 °F (2 °C) within a radius of 3,300 feet (one kilometer). It can also be disruptive to electronic devices and induce earaches. It uses powerful radio waves to help it study the surrounding area. Magneton's anti-gravitational powers enable it to fly through the air. Being composed of three Magnemite, it is about three times as powerful electrically, though not three times as intelligent. Even though Magneton is a mechanical creature, it still needs to eat. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode The Poké Spokesman , food for Magneton consists of electrical currents. It is usually found in rough terrain , often near power plants . When sunspots flare up, Magneton tends to appear more often, presumably due to the changes in the sun's magnetic field. When rain clouds form, it also gathers in high areas prone to lightning strikes. As seen in the eleventh chapter of Pokémon Adventures , it possesses the ability to form its electricity into both platforms and barriers. As seen in the Pokémon Horizons: The Series episode The Future I Choose , it can cause interference with phone and internet signals. In An Unexpected Picnic! , a herd of Magneton produced an EMP that could destroy computer software. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, carvings depicting Magneton have been discovered at the Ruins of Alph . One was shown in the Pokémon Generations episode The Redemption in a flashback to the great war of Kalos , indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. Additionally, Sandy Shocks bears a strong resemblance to Magneton. It is believed to be an ancient Magneton that was alive 10,000 years ago. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Magneton is known to sleep with its three linked Magnemite either stuck together or drifting apart by a strong magnetic force.It is theoried that its magnetism is unstable while Magneton sleeps.",Magneton evolves from Magnemite and evolves into Magnezone .

The poisons secreted by the spines and horn are extremely potent, and even a scratch from its horn or a drop of poison from its barbs can be deadly. However, this docile Pokémon only uses its poison when it feels threatened. Nidoran♀ is more sensitive to smell than Nidoran♂ . It can use its whiskers to check the wind while searching for berries or avoiding predators. Nidoran♀ can use its incisor teeth to crush the berries it forages for.

It has three digits on each hand and foot, but its fingers are considerably shorter than its toes. Two of its toes face forward and one faces backward. Its tail is thick and long, with a brown band located near the tip. Abra can sense danger through a telepathic radar. When it does, it teleports to a safe location. However, it sometimes becomes panicked if it wakes in an unknown location. By hypnotizing itself, Abra is able to teleport itself even while sleeping. It can use other extrasensory abilities while sleeping as well and can even teleport into the treetops to pick and eat Berries . The deeper Abra sleeps, the farther it teleports. Due to the strain of its telepathic powers, however, Abra sleeps 18 hours each day. If it fails to rest long enough, it will become unable to use its powers. The contents in Abra's dream can affect its powers. Abra lives in urban areas , but has been observed to teleport to a different location once per hour.

Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown. Its light tan arms are also connected to its upper body. Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body. Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner four and are roughly half as tall as Kingler's entire body. Its hips visibly protrude from its lower body and connect to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. Kingler's main features are its orange pincers. Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and is as hard as steel. Kingler is often found on the edges of water , usually the ocean. Its powerful claws have 10,000 horsepower and are capable of prying open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster . While Kingler's large, left claw is its main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it. It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use. However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around.

It also has a strong enough immune system to survive in the most polluted of waters. However, it is usually overlooked by Trainers because of its slow movements and physical weakness: even in the heat of battle, it will do nothing but flop around. It is believed that the ancestors of Magikarp were actually much stronger than modern Magikarp, and this led scientists to research this species. Magikarp is found in many bodies of water , such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. However, due to its weak swimming ability, it usually lives downstream of the water's flow.

Snorlax also tends to sleep on areas with bridges, often blocking others from crossing through. Professor Neroli does research on Snorlax, particularly on their ability to attract Pokémon around them to sleep. A lot of Pokémon tend to gather around Snorlax to sleep near it or on it. Snorlax is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake .",Snorlax evolves from Munchlax .
123,Scyther,1,70,110,80,55,80,105,"Scyther is a bipedal, insectoid Pokémon . Its body is primarily green and has a thin, cream-colored section between its head, thorax, and abdomen. Female Scyther have larger abdomens than male Scyther. Its reptilian head has two narrow, triangular eyes and three blunt horns extending from its forehead. Its arms end in large, white scythes, which it uses for both hunting and fighting. Two pairs of cream-colored wings extend from its back. While these wings do allow Scyther to fly, it rarely does so. Scyther's thighs have large, upward-pointing spikes. Its feet are tall, rounded, and conical, almost extending to its thighs; each foot ends in three small, white claws on its front side. Scyther is an adept hunter that tears at its prey with its scythes. Thanks to its green coloration, it can camouflage itself well in the grasslands and forests where it lives. Humans rarely encounter wild Scyther in these areas, however. Said to be like a ninja, Scyther can move so quickly that it cannot be followed, increasing the effectiveness of its scythes. It maintains the sharpness of its blades through battle as well as by cutting through hard objects, such as trees; it can cut down a massive tree with just a single slice, although it cannot penetrate Tarountula 's elastic threads. The Pokémon the Series episode Tracey Gets Bugged showed that wild Scyther form swarms with a single leader chosen through combat. When a challenger successfully defeats a current leader and replaces it, the defeated leader is exiled from the swarm. In Showdown at Dark City , it was shown that Scyther becomes aggressive when faced with the color red.",Scyther evolves into either Scizor or Kleavor .
57,Primeape,1,65,105,60,60,70,95,"Primeape is a bipedal, simian Pokémon with a round body covered in light beige, shaggy fur. There is usually a throbbing vein on the left side of its forehead, and it has triangular ears with pink insides, narrow eyes with tiny pupils, and a pink, snout-like nose. Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles. This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights. The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes. Primeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious. When it becomes enraged, its blood circulation is boosted. This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence. Primeape also possesses the ability to convert its anger into energy to attack its opponents with. It has sturdy vessels in its brain that keep it healthy despite its constant anger. It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught up to its target. Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it. Some researchers have a theory Primeape is angry even when inside a Poké Ball . In some cases, Primeape has been known to die as a result of its rage, commonly after repeatedly using its signature move Rage Fist until the blood vessels in its head burst from the force. This causes its rage to transcend its physical form and evolve into Annihilape , which may explain why Primeape is also said to look peaceful in death. In the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-ké Corral , it is shown to have a fondness for bananas. Primeape can be found on mountains. It competes with Ursaring when it comes to searching for berries. In Paldea , Hawlucha is Primeape's natural enemy. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , it is very rare to find a Primeape sleeping without rage, possibly from exhausting itself. Primeape and its evolved form, Annihilape , are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Rage Fist .",Primeape evolves from Mankey and evolves into Annihilape .
50,Diglett,1,10,55,25,35,45,95,"Diglett is a tiny, brown Pokémon that seems to be perpetually buried within the earth, leaving only its head visible. Its small stature makes it both the lightest and shortest Ground-type . It has beady black eyes and a large, round, pink nose. A Diglett in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team mentions that it has feet, though their size and appearance are unknown. It spends much of its time underground and has very thin skin. If Diglett is exposed to sunlight, its blood will heat up and cause it to grow weak. Diglett lives in tunnels and caves under the earth, where it feeds on tree roots and vegetables. It is known to live in burrows left behind by Onix . It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests and has even been shown to live inside of trees. Diglett digs regularly through the earth at a shallow depth, leaving perfectly tilled soil in its wake. Some farmers welcome Diglett because it tills their fields and its droppings enrich the soil, but others consider it a pest for eating their vegetables. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Diglett is known to sleep underground during the night. Seeing a Diglett asleep above ground is considered to be good luck. In Generation II , Diglett and its evolved form, Dugtrio , were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Fissure .",Diglett evolves into Dugtrio .
95,Onix,1,35,45,160,30,45,70,"Onix is a Pokémon composed of a giant chain of gray boulders that become smaller towards the tail. Its length makes it the tallest Rock-type Pokémon. It has black eyes and a rounded snout. On top of its head is a rocky spine. As it grows older, it becomes more rounded and smoother, eventually becoming similar to black diamonds. Inside its brain is a magnet that serves as an internal compass, guiding Onix wherever they need to go and prevents them from getting lost while digging. Onix tunnels under the ground at over 50 miles (80 kilometers) per hour, which causes tremors and a terrifying roar that echoes a long way. Hard objects encountered while tunneling are absorbed into its body, which makes it very sturdy. It also consumes the boulders for food. The massive, winding tunnels it leaves behind are used as homes by Diglett . As seen in the Pokémon Stadium series , Onix is capable of rotating its head, or any part of its body, in a full 360 degrees. It is a very aggressive Pokémon that will constantly attack humans and other Pokémon when in pain, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode To Master the Onixpected! . As seen in the Pokémon Adventures manga, Onix can be separated from its body segments in battle and be fine later on, either regenerating or reattaching to its body segments.It is said that an Onix that lives for about 100 years will evolve into a Steelix after its composition becomes more diamond-like. It can be found in mountains and caves . As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Onix is known on occasion to sleep while in the middle of digging through tunnels.Onix is believed to be a deep sleeper due to the protection offered by its sturdy body.",Onix evolves into Steelix .
56,Mankey,1,40,80,35,35,45,70,"Mankey is a small, simian Pokémon , similar to a New World monkey . It is bipedal and has a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur. Its nose is similar to a pig's snout, and it has narrow, red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides. Mankey's three-fingered hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown. Mankey specializes in physical fighting and is very aggressive and short-tempered. When angry, it begins shaking and its breathing turns rough. Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee. It will rampage until it falls asleep, but its anger remains in its dreams. This causes it to wake up and become furious all over again. However, this constant release of stress grants it a long life. Mankey can be found in the mountains , where it lives in treetop colonies. If one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason. If it loses sight of its colony or if it is left alone to rage, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated. According to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts . However, Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them. It becomes agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell. Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at the Po-ké Corral . As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , it is rare to find a Mankey sleeping without an angry look on its face.","Mankey evolves into Primeape , which evolves into Annihilape ."

It has narrow eyes containing white sclera and pupil with red irises, rounded ears with cream-colored insides, and a single whisker on each cheek. Its long tail is tightly curled at the end. Its most notable feature is its large teeth. Female Rattata have shorter whiskers . Rattata is a fidgety Pokémon who can live wherever it can find food , which it searches for most of the day. Its long and sharp fangs, which can chew on nearly anything, continuously grow throughout its lifetime and leave it unable to eat if they become too long, so it nibbles on hard objects to whittle them down and avoid starving to death. If its Trainer doesn't give it something to gnaw on, it will end up chewing on door frames and table legs among other objects. When it is threatened, Rattata can deliver a powerful bite. It is very cautious, so it constantly keeps its ears up, even while asleep, and will immediately scurry away from the slightest sound. Furret is the natural predator of Rattata. Although it mainly lives in plains and savannas , its hardiness lets it live in many environments, including dirty ones, where it forms its nest. When it finds a place where food is available, it settles down and produces offspring. Because it reproduces so quickly, a pair of Rattata can quickly colonize an area, making it a common sight. Seeing one indicates that over 40 of them are around. As shown in Pokémon Sleep , Rattata is known to sleep sometimes with a log in its mouth. It will wake itself up with the sound of its teeth grinding if it does not take good care of them. Prior to Generation IV , Rattata and Raticate were the only known Pokémon capable of learning the moves Hyper Fang and Super Fang .",Rattata evolves into Raticate .
100,Voltorb,1,40,30,50,55,55,100,"Voltorb is a spherical Pokémon that resembles a buttonless Poké Ball with eyes. The top half is red, while the bottom half is white. Because of its resemblance to Poké Balls, it is thought that it was created when one was exposed to an energy pulse. This is supported by the fact that its components do not occur naturally. Voltorb is generally found in power plants and other areas with electric fields where it feeds. It was first discovered in the plant where modern Poké Balls were invented. It has a volatile temperament and will explode if agitated or bumped by the slightest contact. Due to being constantly mistaken as a Poké Ball , Voltorb has reportedly zapped many humans as a result.",Voltorb evolves into Electrode .
94,Gengar,1,60,65,60,130,75,110,"Gengar is a dark purple, bipedal Pokémon with a roundish body. It has red eyes, a wide mouth that is usually curled into a sinister grin, and pointed ears. On its back are numerous spikes, and it has smaller spikes on top of its head similar to tufty fur. Its arms and legs are short with three digits on both its hands and feet. It also has a stubby tail. Gengar has the ability to hide perfectly in the shadow of any object, granting it exceptional stealth. Its body acts as a heat sink , cooling the temperature of the surrounding area by nearly 10 °F (5 °C) by absorbing its warmth. It is shown in Pokémon the Series that Gengar can fly,turn intangible,possess peopleand other Pokémon, create illusions, pass through dimensions,and extend its tongue by several meters.In certain media, such as POKÉMON Detective Pikachu and the Pokémon Ranger series , it is also able to create copies of itself. Gengar is very mischievous, and at times, malicious. It enjoys playing practical jokes and casting curses, such as pretending to be one's shadow during a full moon, then behaving erratically, or attacking people who get lost in the mountains. When the quarry notices, Gengar takes delight in its victim's terror. However, it has been known to be loyal to a Trainer who treats it well. It waits in people's shadows or the dark areas of their homes before stealing their life force. This is because it was once a human and wishes for a traveling companion. Being the result of Evolution via trading , Gengar is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in caves and dark places where shadows form. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Gengar is known to sleep deeply while hiding in the shadow of a target it plans to curse. In Generation I , Night Shade was Gengar's signature move .",Gengar evolves from Haunter and is the final form of Gastly .
92,Gastly,1,30,35,30,100,35,80,"Gastly has no true form, due to 95% of its body being poisonous gas, with the other 5% believed to be made up of the souls of those who died from the gas. However, it consistently appears as a black, spherical Pokémon surrounded by a purple haze. Gastly has a wide, pink mouth with two visible fangs. Though its eyes seem to extend past its round body, visible eyelids surround them. It produces a faint, sweet smell. The toxic gas surrounding the main body can induce fainting and suffocation, and it is capable of enshrouding an enemy of any size. Gastly's gaseous form makes it one of the lightest Pokémon in existence. The Pokémon the Series episode The Tower of Terror suggests that Gastly has a playful personality, often frightening and playing pranks on people for fun. However, in the episode A Shipful of Shivers , it shows a willingness to preserve or pass on the memories of departed humans. It is also shown in The Ghost of Maiden's Peak changing form and creating illusions, and it is capable of phasing through solid objects and forming tangible hands out of its gasses. Gastly can be found within caves and old, dilapidated buildings, but may also be seen outdoors during nighttime. Its gaseous body will dwindle away when exposed to strong winds, so they huddle together in decent-sized groups under house eaves to avoid the wind. It may also cause flickering lights in abandoned houses.

It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell. Its shell is harder than a diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes. On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth. Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen. Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside. This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike. Cloyster typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent. However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed. With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled. The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming. It swallows seawater and then ejects it towards the rear, pushing it through with siphon-jet propulsion. Being the result of Shellder evolving through an Evolution stone , Cloyster is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found on the sea floor , nestled among the rocks and coral; however, it will actively hunt on land for Slowpoke tails. Cloyster and its pre-evolved form, Shellder , are relatives of Gastrodon . Kingler is a natural predator of Cloyster. In Generation I , Clamp was its signature move .

Three blue, crystal orbs adorn its body: one on its neck and two on its tail. Dragonair emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance. As seen in Pikachu's Rescue Adventure , it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided. Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystals on its neck and tail. This causes its body to brighten and give off a different aura that changes the weather in its vicinity. As a result, Dragonair has been referred as a ""divine Pokémon"" since ancient times by agricultural peoples. Dragonair is a rare Pokémon that inhabits pristine seas and lakes . The lakes Dragonair lives in are usually filled with offerings from people in gratitude. It is said that a person who sees a Dragonair at the start of a year will be healthy for the whole year.

7,Squirtle,1,44,48,65,50,64,43,"Squirtle is a small reptilian Pokémon that resembles a light-blue turtle . While it typically walks on its two short legs, it has been shown to run on all fours in Super Smash Bros. Brawl . It has large, purplish, or reddish eyes and a slightly hooked upper lip. Each of its hands and feet has three pointed digits. The end of its long, squirrel-like tail curls inward. Its body is encased by a tough shell that forms and hardens after birth. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves. Squirtle's shell is a useful tool. It can withdraw into its shell for protection or to sleep. The grooved, rounded shape helps to reduce water resistance, allowing the Pokémon to swim at high speeds. Squirtle can spray foamy water from its mouth with great accuracy. Squirtle is scarce in the wild, although it can be found around small ponds and lakes . Squirtle can also be found residing around rivers in mountainous regions, as shown in Pokémon Snap and Pokémon Scarlet and Violet . In the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise , Squirtle is shown to be found living on secluded islands with other members of their evolutionary line. Sharpedo is a natural predator of Squirtle. As shown in Pokémon Sleep , Squirtle is known to sleep by withdrawing its limbs and head into its shell to protect itself from threats.

25,Pikachu,1,35,55,30,50,40,90,"Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pokémon . It is covered in yellow fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, and brown eyes. Each cheek is a red circle that contains a pouch for electricity storage. It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail is a patch of brown fur. A female Pikachu has a ""V""-shaped notch at the end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is classified as a quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on its hind legs; therefore, Pikachu is a facultative biped. Pikachu stores electric energy using the small pouches in its cheeks in case it is attacked, so one might feel a small shock if it is touched. These pouches become electrically charged during the night as it sleeps, so a dozy Pikachu may occasionally discharge electricity after waking up. If it does not get enough sleep, it will not be able to release said electricity at its full power. When angered or threatened, Pikachu quickly unleashes the electric energy from its cheeks, which can reach the intensity of a lightning bolt. This also serves as a sign that it's wary, and it will feel stressed if it's unable to fully release the electricity. In Sparks Fly for Magnemite , Pikachu is shown to accumulate energy in its glands, which it will need to eject to avoid complications. When several Pikachu form a group, they are capable of causing thunder storms by building up electricity. If one Pikachu sees another one who is weakened and in need of help, it revitalizes it by recharging it with an electric shock. In Alola , a plan was recently announced to help build an electric power plant by gathering many Pikachu. If its cheek sacs are very soft and stretchy, this means that it can generate powerful electricity. As shown in Pokémon Sleep , Pikachu is known to emit electricity through its cheeks while sleeping, perhaps because it's dreaming of firing electric shots. Pikachu is a curious, playful, and intelligent Pokémon who primarily eats fruits and roasts Berries with its electricity to make them tender enough to eat. However, it can end up accidentally burning them too much if it underestimates the intensity of its charge, as it has a tendency to blast new things it finds. In The Electric Tale of Pikachu , it is also depicted eating and sometimes destroying telephone poles, wires, and other electronic equipment. Pikachu raises its tail to monitor its surroundings and bites people who yank it, as it does not like having it pulled. While doing this, its tail is sometimes struck by lightning. Wild Pikachu live in forested areas away from people and with others of its kind in nests, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Pikachu's Goodbye . Such forests are dangerous, though, as trees there are often struck by lightning. When Pikachu meet, their tails make contact and they exchange electricity through them to greet each other. Relatedly, in A Plethora of Pikachu! , it is shown that Pikachu from Alola are known to greet each other by sniffing one another and rubbing their tails together. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, it is considered exceptionally rare, though it seems to be a quite common Pokémon in other forms of media. Many Pokémon Trainers prefer Pikachu's cute appearance over Raichu 's, which is why the latter is not commonly seen among them. Because of the popularity of Pikachu-themed merchandise, Mimikyu dresses itself in a Pikachu cloth in an effort to look less scary and make friends and appease its loneliness.Unfortunately, its creepy costume only ends up doing the opposite. By occasion, Pikachu can get unintentionally swallowed by Cramorant . While startled, it looks for ways to escape from the latter. Pikachu, along with Pichu and Raichu, is related to Pachirisu .",Pikachu evolves from Pichu and evolves into Raichu .

Covering Victreebel's mouth is a leaf with a long, brown, yellow-tipped vine growing out of it. The acid produced by Victreebel can corrode any material, regardless of its hardness. Victreebel is said to live in huge colonies deep in jungles, although no one has ever returned from there. Being the result of exposure to an Evolution stone , Victreebel is rarely found in the wild, though they can be found in temperate forests and jungles . The vine on its leaf is flicked to mimic an animal in order to attract prey. It also produces a sweet scent of nectar or honey to further aid in luring its victims. Acid that has dissolved numerous prey becomes sweeter and even more effective at attracting prey. In the Pokémon Adventures chapter A Hollow Victreebel , Victreebel hoards food, usually small birds and rodents, and collects Leaf Stones to perform Evolution rituals at night to help Weepinbell become Victreebel as well. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Victreebel is known to sleep with its mouth open to draw in prey.Very rarely however, it forgets about luring in prey and instead chooses to sleep face down.",Victreebel evolves from Weepinbell and is the final form of Bellsprout .

The flame can indicate Charmander's health and mood, burning brightly when the Pokémon is strong, weakly when it is exhausted, wavering when it is happy, and blazing when it is enraged. It is said that Charmander would die if its flame were to go out. However, if the Pokémon is healthy, the flame will continue to burn even if it gets a bit wet and is said to steam in the rain. Charmander can be found in hot, mountainous areas . It has been recently seen living in the Terarium of Blueberry Academy . However, it is found far more often in the ownership of Trainers . As seen in Pokémon Snap and New Pokémon Snap , Charmander exhibits pack behavior, calling others of its species if it finds food and watching the flames on each other's tails to ensure they don't go out. As shown in Pokémon Sleep , Charmander is known to sleep while curled up. Supposedly, it draws warmth from the flame on its tail. During quiet nights, the sounds of its flame can be heard by listening carefully while Charmander sleeps.","Charmander evolves into Charmeleon , which evolves into Charizard ."

The core resembles a golden metal casing with a red gem in the center, which is held in place by a golden ring looped around Staryu's lower left point. Staryu have no jointed limbs to speak of, instead using their psychic powers to move themselves around. If any of Staryu's appendages are lost or eaten by predators like Lumineon , it is unharmed and can grow them back with ease provided the core is still intact. When the sun goes down, Staryu's core glows its brightest. Many Staryu will float from the seafloor to the surface and align themselves with stars of the night sky as their core flickers, displaying a connection with the celestial bodies of space. In the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode Bye Bye Psyduck , it is shown that if Staryu becomes weak, its core will grow faint and flash slowly. During the ends of summer, groups of Staryu tend to gather while lighting up in a steady rhythm. Staryu can be found at the very bottom of the ocean on the seafloors . However, there are times when Staryu finds itself in rivers that lead into the ocean, as seen in Pokémon Snap . In Generation III , Camouflage was its signature move . In the Pocket Monsters Encyclopedia , and the original Japanese version of the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City , Staryu is classified as hermaphroditic .",Staryu evolves into Starmie .

There is also a pair of white antennae sprouting from the top of its head. However, the most prominent feature on its face are its large, red compound eyes . Venonat's highly developed eyes act as radar units and can shoot powerful beams. Venonat can be found in dense temperate forests , where it will sleep in the hole of a tree until nightfall. It sleeps throughout the day because the small insects it feeds on appear only at night. Both Venonat and its prey are attracted to bright lights.",Venonat evolves into Venomoth .

Its body is light blue with a dark blue marking around its head and a spiky ridge down its spine. It has black eyes and a tiny black nose. There is a white fin encircling its neck and three fins with cream-colored webbing on its head. Two of these fins are on either side of its head, similar to ears; and one is directly on top of its head, resembling a dorsal fin . Vaporeon is a quadruped with three small toes on each foot and dark blue paw pads on the hind feet. A spontaneous mutation caused Eevee to grow fins and gills to become better suited to an aquatic lifestyle. Vaporeon lives close to clear waters and is often found quietly resting by its preferred habitats, which are beautiful and clean freshwater lakes and shores, though it has also been observed in coastal ocean waters near coral reefs and blue holes. It is mostly found in urban settings under the ownership of a Pokémon Trainer . Vaporeon's split tail fin, which is used for swimming, has been mistaken for a mermaid's in the past and is believed to be the origin of mermaid folklore. It freely controls water and can melt into it to become invisible thanks to its cell structure being similar to water molecules. As a result, it can remain camouflaged while swimming to ambush its prey, which consists of fish Pokémon. Vaporeon can detect moisture with its fins, which vibrate when it senses incoming rain.",Vaporeon evolves from Eevee .

Each of its feet has three claws on them. The bulb on its back has bloomed into a giant pink bud. A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud. The weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from running fast and standing on its hind legs, forcing its legs to grow sturdy. When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling. Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming Evolution . Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant. Ivysaur is typically found in plains . As shown in Pokémon Sleep , Ivysaur is known to sleep in sunny spots while undergoing its photosynthesis process.

Its hips are visible on the lower front of its body connected to its four long, thin legs. Each leg has a single, claw-like foot. The main features of Krabby's body are the two large, red pincers at the end of its arms. Krabby uses them as its main form of offense, and as a form of balance. Sometimes, Krabby may lose a claw during battle or have a damaged claw forcibly removed. However, the claw regenerates over a short period. In the wild, Krabby lives near the edge of water in both fresh and salt water. Krabby is most commonly found on beaches where it burrows in the sand. In times of scarce food sources, it may eat sand to regain nutrients and will be very aggressive in defending its home. Its main form of defense is creating foam to shroud its body, in order to confuse opponents into thinking that it is bigger than it actually is. As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Mystery at the Lighthouse , Krabby generally keeps to itself, but will quickly defend itself if provoked.

The front starfish has a golden formation in the center. In the center of the golden casing is its red jewel core, an exterior organ which can glow in seven colors and has developed to resemble a cut precious stone. The second starfish is semi-attached to the back of the first and can spin 360 degrees. This rotational action is how Starmie swims through the ocean. It can also launch itself out of the water and fly through the air for short periods, as seen in Pokémon Snap . From its core, Starmie can emit electrical waves that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe. The multi-color glowing of its core is also believed to be a method of communication with other members of its species. As seen in the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode The Water Flowers of Cerulean City , the core will go dark if Starmie is knocked unconscious and will sometimes flicker if Starmie is low on health. Because of its body shape and habit of sending transmissions skyward, some people believe this Pokémon to be extraterrestrial . It has been known to cause headaches on people when approached.

The abdominal stinger contains Beedrill's most potent poison. Beedrill is highly territorial and, unlike real wasps and bees, Beedrill are not confirmed to live in true ""hives"", as they work together to solve basic problems regarding food, territory, and reproduction without any confirmation if there is a singular breeding pair or ""Queen."" As seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Challenge of the Samurai , Beedrill seems to be especially concerned with the welfare of Weedle and Kakuna , responding aggressively to those that disturb them. Disturbing one Beedrill will cause the whole group to attack. It flies at high speed and attacks using the large venomous stingers on its forelegs and abdomen. It will then take the victims of its attacks back to its nest for food. Beedrill nests in temperate forests and misty wooded areas. It is known to collect pollen, which Teddiursa combines with fruits to concoct honey . In the twelfth chapter of Pokémon Adventures , Beedrill is shown living in groups or packs and producing honey.

It has three Phillips head screws on its body: two near the bottom of its body and the one on top of its head that looks similar to an antenna. The two bottom screws serve no noticeable purpose, although they may be its feet as the Pokédex identifies a footprint similar to that of the screw's head. Even though Magnemite and its evolved forms are mechanical creatures, it is shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Get Along, Little Pokémon that it has emotions and a way of reproducing. In The Poké Spokesman , it exhibited the need to eat, although its main form of nutrition are electrical currents. It is commonly found in locations such as power plants or caves with a strong magnetic field. Despite its modern, artificial appearance, Magnemite has been depicted in carvings discovered at the Ruins of Alph . It has also been present in AZ 's retelling of the Kalos war, indicating it has existed for at least 3,000 years. The magnetic units on Magnemite's body generate an electromagnetic field that allows it to defy gravity and can potentially disrupt electrical equipment. The units generate stronger magnetic fields the faster they rotate. Magnemite is not known to be unnecessarily aggressive but they may approach Trainers with little notice. If a wild Magnemite is approached, it may simply flee on rare occasions, as Magnemite does not care for interaction. However, if attacked, it will retaliate with non-damaging moves. In the care of a Trainer, it can be a devoted fighter. However, as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode The Poké Spokesman , it's shown that it may be deterred unless a strong bond is formed with its Trainer. Should it run out of electricity, Magnemite will fall to the ground. Usually, batteries can help recharge it in order for Magnemite to start moving again. Magnemite can be attracted to anything emitting electricity or a magnetic field, including gadgets such as a Pokétch . In the episode Sparks Fly for Magnemite , it is shown to be attracted to electric Pokémon producing such fields. With modern electrical lines buried underground, Magnemite attacks on power plants have increased. To prevent power outages, these power plants deliberately send out signals Magnemite cannot stand to ward them off. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Magnemite is known to sleep airbone by generating electromagnetic waves from its side magnets.There are rare occasions where while Magnemite sleeps and muddles to the direction of its waves, it will loop in the air while sleeping.","Magnemite evolves into Magneton , which evolves into Magnezone ."
11,Metapod,1,50,20,55,25,25,30,"Metapod is an insect Pokémon that resembles a green chrysalis . Its body is crescent-shaped, with several segments making up the lower point. It has two heavy-lidded eyes on the sides of its shell, while the front of its shell feature geometrically shaped portions and projections, and the back has three pointed protrusions; two veering towards the sides, and one in the middle. In certain angles, the back of a Metapod's shell resembles a face alongside the eyes on the sides, with one of the protrusions resembling a sharply pointed nose, and the tail resembling a sharply pointed chin. Metapod's soft body is protected by a hard outer shell as it undergoes metamorphosis . While this shell is said to be as hard as steel, a sudden, powerful impact could cause its liquid innards to pop out, leaving it completely exposed. Metapod generally remains motionless, rebuilding its cells for Evolution. If an enemy discovers Metapod, it cannot do anything other than harden its outer shell. Metapod lives in temperate forests and jungles , often in groups. Pikipek is a natural predator of Metapod.

Its top half is white, while its lower half is red. The Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards depict Electrode as hollow. Electrode tends to live in power plants where fresh electricity is being generated, which it consumes. As a result, it often causes blackouts. The more electric energy Electrode consumes, the faster it moves. When full of stored electricity, it has been known to drift with the wind. Electrode explodes in response to even the smallest stimulation, simply to entertain itself, or because it has taken in too much electricity. However, unlike Voltorb, Electrode can control its explosive ability at will. This unpredictable and explosive nature has earned it the nickname of ""Bomb Ball"". Because of its appearance, many Trainers try to pick Electrode up, mistaking it for an item. As seen in the anime, if Electrode explode to defend themselves, this also results in them using up their energy and becoming extremely worn out.",Electrode evolves from Voltorb .
26,Raichu,1,60,90,55,90,80,100,"Raichu is a bipedal, rodent -like Pokémon . Even though it's classified as bipedal, Raichu usually gets around on all fours.

There is a circular yellow marking on each cheek where its electric sacs are, and it has a triangular, dark brown nose. Its arms and feet have patches of brown fur at the end, and the soles of its long feet are tan with a circular orange pad in the center. On its back are two horizontal brown stripes. Its long, thin tail has a lightning bolt-shaped end, with the tip being chipped on females . Raichu's tail serves as a ground to protect itself from its own high-voltage power by releasing electricity into the surface. Conversely, it can gather electricity when planted underground like a rod or from the atmosphere. Raichu exudes a weak electrical charge from its body which makes it glow slightly in the dark. It can store over 100,000 volts of electricity, which is enough to knock out foes several times its size, such as a Copperajah or Dragonite . If Raichu's sacs are fully charged, its ears will stand straight up, and its muscles will be stimulated. However, possibly as a result of stress, it becomes more aggressive as it stores electricity and may even threaten its Trainer . If its sacs are excessively charged, it discharges electricity through its tail into the ground, leading to scorched patches near its nest. Being the result of Evolution via Evolution stone , Raichu is rarely found in the wild , though they can be found in forests and woodlands . Part of the reason why Raichu is rarely seen with Trainers is because people prefer the look it had as a Pikachu . As revealed in the Pokémon the Series episode Electric Shock Showdown , Raichu is not capable of learning speed-based moves such as Agility and Quick Attack upon evolving and is only able to when it is still a Pikachu. Raichu, along with Pikachu and Pichu , is related to Pachirisu . In Pokémon Sleep , it is shown that Raichu sometimes releases electricity while sleeping, so anyone who approaches it is at risk of being electrocuted. It may also plant its tail into the ground as it rests. Raichu and its pre-evolved forms are the only known Pokémon capable of learning the move Volt Tackle .",Raichu evolves from Pikachu and is the final form of Pichu .

A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of its spine, bypassing its neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resemble a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. Its tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb. According to journals found in Kanto 's Pokémon Mansion , after discovering the Mythical Pokémon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Mr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pokémon in existence. It was held and studied in the mansion, where it acquired extreme power and a vicious disposition after enduring horrific gene-splicing experiments. It eventually broke free and fled the mansion, destroying it in the process. In the Pokémon Adventures manga, Mewtwo 's creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew 's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells were used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist Blaine . Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life. Though its DNA is almost the same as Mew's, it is bigger and has a different disposition. Mewtwo is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes. Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, it is said to be resting in dark caves somewhere. In Mewtwo Strikes Back , Mewtwo was shown to be capable of levitation, mind control, memory erasure, telepathy , teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful, world-destroying storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened , Mewtwo can survive in outer space. In POKÉMON Detective Pikachu , Mewtwo can transfer a human's soul into a Pokémon provided that said Pokémon is in a crazed state, causing the transferred person to gain control of its body and abilities.",

Pidgeotto's beak and legs are pink. Two of its toes point forward, while one points backward. Additionally, it has powerful, sharp talons that it uses to grasp prey. Pidgeotto is a powerful flier capable of carrying prey several miles to its nest. It has amazing vision, which helps it locate preferred prey Pokémon such as Exeggcute and Magikarp . The Pokémon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pokémon depicts it preying on Caterpie . Pidgeotto claims a sprawling territory of more than 60 miles (100 kilometers), which it defends fiercely. Its nest is usually in the center of its territory and it circles its territory throughout the day, looking out for food and intruders. It is most often found in temperate forests .

There are five blunt protrusions on top of its head, and it has structures resembling pads over its shoulders. It appears to be wearing a light purple tunic and kilt, as well as red boxing gloves and light purple boxing shoes. The gloves are actually masses of muscle. In between the tunic and kilt is a small, black area. As its appearance suggests, Hitmonchan specializes in punching. It can throw punches that are too quick to be seen with the naked eye. These punches are said to be as fast as a bullet train. It starts attacking foes with combo punches from both sides before finishing with a single straight punch. A single straight punch by Hitmonchan can launch foes over 300 mph. By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete. Even a light graze from its punches will result in a burn. However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting. Despite the need for frequent breaks, it has an unwavering spirit and will never give up in a difficult situation. Usually found in urban areas , it is rarely seen in the wild. It often competes with Hitmonlee and Hitmontop . In Generation II , Mach Punch was its signature move , but Tyrogue could still inherit it via breeding .

Two powerful water cannons/jet nozzles reside at the top of its shell over its shoulders. These cannons can be extended or withdrawn. Blastoise's head has triangular ears that are black on the inside, small brown eyes, and a cream-colored lower jaw. Its arms are thick, and it has three claws on each hand. Its feet have three claws on the front and one on the back. Poking out of the bottom of its shell is a stubby tail. The powerful cannons on this Pokémon's back can produce water blasts that can pierce steel and concrete and be used for high-speed charges and propelling itself in the air. The speed of Blastoise's charges is similar to the force of a rocket. Blastoise makes itself heavy to withstand these powerful blasts and crush its opponents. It is shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Blastoise can take the role of a leader in large groups of Squirtle and Wartortle . Its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes . Blastoise is capable of flying by propelling itself with water from the back openings of its shell. As shown in Pokémon Sleep , Blastoise is known to sleep soundly while protected by its tough shell. It has also been seen sleeping with its belly exposed on very rare occasions, meaning that it is feeling completely secure in its surroundings and has quickly fallen asleep.

The smaller, right head simply has two pointed teeth, one at each corner of its mouth. The larger head has a cream-colored skull-and-crossbones marking below its face, while the smaller head has a ring marking instead. It is covered with many geyser-like protrusions, which usually expel mustard-colored gases. Weezing is said to form when poisonous gases pool and two Koffing fuse over many years. Very rarely, two Koffing can become a Weezing in a short time span because of a sudden mutation. Triplet Weezing have been discovered, although they are extremely rare. Each of Weezing's heads contains a different toxin. It mixes its gases by inflating one head and deflating the other. When its gases mix, Weezing becomes more toxic and putrid. Weezing can hover in midair, presumably due to gases lighter than air, as is the case for Koffing. Despite their stench and poison, Weezing's gases can be used to make top-grade perfume by diluting them to the highest level. Weezing lives in urban areas . It seeks a dirty, unkempt house and nests there. At night, when the people in the house are asleep, it will go through the trash. Weezing feeds on the dust, microorganisms, and especially gases emitted by garbage and toxic waste. Weezing's body expands and smells worse upon inhaling poisonous gases. The Kantonian Weezing used to be common in Galar and created more potent toxins than their Galarian relatives.",Weezing evolves from Koffing .

Golbat's fangs have hollow tubes (similar to straws) specialized for sucking blood. The sharp fangs of Golbat are capable of piercing even the hardest of hides. While they are strong enough to pierce thick hide, they are also unexpectedly fragile. There are some Golbat that have missing fangs as a result of their hunger-fueled attempt to try drinking blood from Steel-type Pokémon. Golbat feeds on the blood of both Pokémon and humans and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 milliliters) of blood in one sitting. It is gluttonous, and drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed. It occasionally gorges itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn. However, it is also willing to share gathered blood with other members of its kind that are hungry. One particular Golbat could utilize Supersonic to produce a magic mirror in its mouth for scrying to see things from a distance, even if walls or land are in the way.

Its thin legs are brown lead to small feet with two large gray claws. Before it went extinct, Kabutops was in the process of evolving into a land dweller as evident by changes in its gills and legs. This change is thought to be due to its prey moving onto land as well. In its ocean home , Kabutops could tuck up its limbs to help it swim extremely fast, up to roughly 29 knots. It used its sharp scythes to slice enemies and drink their internal fluids. Any leftovers left behind by Kabutops are consumed by other Pokémon.

In 3D games, such as Pokémon Stadium , it can open its beak and can detach its limbs and head from its torso. According to its Pokédex entries , it has copy protection built into its code, preventing duplication through electronic means. It was created in 1995 by Silph Co. ,but documents at Silph Co. claim it was created at the Pokémon Lab on Cinnabar Island using the state-of-the-art technology of its time. Because it was created decades ago, many of its parts have since become obsolete. Porygon's programming includes only the most fundamental actions. It was the first artificial Pokémon to have ever been created through computer programming. In ancient Hisui , people were confused about Porygon and its Evolutions due to them arriving through space-time distortions and being the product of far more advanced technology than what was available at the time. Due to its man-made origins, Porygon does not need to breathe or eat, though it can still accept food if given. It has the ability to convert its body into digital data, allowing it to travel through cyberspace. Recently, it has become more helpful inside cyberspace by searching for any suspicious data that exists. Some believed Porygon has the power to potentially travel in space despite the species not displaying that ability yet. Because it is man-made, it is generally found in computers or in labs and other buildings where people work.

It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and properties. Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming; being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal. The Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pokémon at once.

It has short arms with three-fingered hands and webbed feet with three toes. Its tail is long and scaly. Females have shorter whiskers . Raticate uses its whiskers to maintain balance, so it slows down if they're cut off. It does not like having its whiskers touched, so it will bite people who do regardless of how friendly they are, and may even bite off someone's hand if provoked enough. Its feet's webbing act as flippers, allowing it to swim in rivers and even oceans to hunt for food . If attacked, Raticate stands up on its hind legs, bares its fangs, and shrieks to intimidate its enemy. Like Rattata , its teeth are strong enough to gnaw through steel and constantly grow, so it often needs to gnaw on something, like rocks and logs, to pare them down. It may even chew on the walls of houses, and is capable of chewing through cinderblocks and toppling concrete buildings. It typically lives in plains and savannas . As shown in Pokémon Sleep , Raticate is known to sleep with a log in its teeth, gnawing at it in the process.

Geodude is proud of its sturdy body and will bash against others of its kind in a contest of sorts to prove whose body is harder. It will even go as far as to compare itself with other species, such as Roggenrola and Carbink . The longer it lives, the more chipped and worn its body becomes. Geodude's roundness makes it easy to pick up, with some people even using it as a substitute for snowballs in snowball fights. However, its toughness and heaviness makes this dangerous for others. Long-lived Geodude are completely smooth and round and have a calm demeanor. However, its heart remains rugged and tough, no matter what. Geodude can be most often found on mountain trails and fields , with a scholar counting about 100 of them on just one route. It will sit still in these areas, which is why it is often mistaken for a rock. It is often stepped on and will sometimes swing its arms in anger when this occurs.

The tentacles break off occasionally, but they can regenerate. The poison from its tentacles is so potent that someone affected by it needs to be immediately rushed to the hospital. Tentacool is not a very strong swimmer, traveling throughout the world using ocean currents. Tentacool searches for food while drifting on the surface of shallow seas. Tentacool can blend in the water, making it very difficult to spot. It will sometimes wash ashore and shrivel up due to dehydration, though it remains equally as dangerous.

Its eyes have yellow sclerae and vertically-slit pupils. It has an oval mouth with a four-sectioned, fang-like beak . In prehistoric times, Omastar swam the seas in search of prey. Omastar uses its highly developed tentacles to ensnare its prey before biting down with its beak, which has enough force to crush rocks. Omastar's diet includes Shellder ; it cracks their shells with its beak before sucking out the contents. Omastar was in turn preyed upon by Carracosta . Despite Omastar's power and dexterity, it is slow and can only catch prey that are within reach of its tentacles. It is believed that Omastar's extinction was a consequence of the increasingly heavy weight of its shell that affected its mobility, including its hunting.

Small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when the mouth is open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb that conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines, which grow from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also provides it with energy through photosynthesis and from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within. Bulbasaur is sometimes seen seen napping in bright sunlight and can survive for days without eating. It is found in grasslands and forests throughout the Kanto region .

Additional flames are present behind its elbows and knees. The fire appears about an hour after hatching. It has four long legs, each ending in a single, gray hoof. These hooves are said to be ten times harder than diamonds and act as shock absorbers. Ponyta are relatively lightweight for their size, as they have extraordinary jumping abilities and are capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound. However, a newborn Ponyta is a weak runner and is actually barely able to stand. It gradually strengthens its legs and becomes faster by chasing after its parents and jumping over grass that grows taller by the day.

85,Dodrio,1,60,110,70,60,60,100,"Dodrio is a large, wingless, three-headed avian Pokémon . Each head has a long, sharp beak and a black V-shaped, feather crest. It has bristly brown feathers covering its head and upper body, while its lower half has a smooth layer of black feathers. Its tail consists of three pale red feathers with lighter tips. Its wingless body rests on two long and slender, but powerful legs with feet that have three clawed toes in front and one in back. A male has black necks, whereas a female has brown necks; both genders have brown legs. Each head has its own working brain and distinct personality. Each head represents and expresses either sorrow, anger, or joy. Despite being separate, it has the innate ability to use all three of its brains to collect data, formulate, and then execute complex plans and strategies. However, on occasion, it may overthink, which causes it to become immobilized and unable to carry out any action whatsoever. Being separate individuals on the same body, the three heads will continue to bicker until they, or at least one of them, gets to eat. This satisfies the other two heads, quelling them and temporarily ending their infighting. The strongest of Dodrio's heads and the thickest neck will become the leader and gain primary control of the body. Another form of adaptation that it has acquired is the ability to have at least one head alert at all times. Extreme caution is advised when all three heads are facing separate directions. It is in this state that it is the most dangerous and going near it may result in a severe pecking. Along with its three heads, it has three sets of hearts and lungs as well. This allows it to efficiently oxygenate and pump blood throughout its body, thus giving it increased endurance to run vast distances without rest. It is especially prone to race vigorously across grassy plains , even in arid seasons with little rainfall. As a result, despite being slower than Doduo , Dodrio can keep running for an even longer time. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Dodrio is known to usually sleep standing up.Each of the three heads taking turns sleeping while one head stays awake. However, should Dodrio become very tired, even the head that remains awake may start to doze off.",Dodrio evolves from Doduo .

It has thin, green leaves sprouting from the top of its body. Exeggutor has three round, light yellow heads that resemble coconuts, each with different facial expressions. Exeggutor's heads think independently and don't appear interested in one another, so it makes a lot of noise as each head speaks its mind. They still appear to get along, though, for they never squabble amongst themselves. If all the heads want to go in a different direction, its body is unable to move. They are able to communicate telepathically as well and sometimes use it to come to a joint decision. It uses psychic powers to fight, and since all three heads are capable its power is tripled. If one of these heads grows too large, it falls off and groups together with others to become an Exeggcute . In the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode The March of the Exeggutor Squad , Exeggutor also has been seen in groups of its own kind, meaning that it is not a solitary Pokémon.

It has long legs and three-toed paws with retractable claws. Persian's lithe muscles also enable it to walk without making a sound. Persian normally lives in towns and cities . Although popular for its elegance, it is extremely difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle and temperamental personality. It will scratch anyone, including its Trainer, with little or no provocation, and has been observed ripping its prey apart for no discernible reason. However, when Persian is yanked by its whiskers, it becomes temporarily docile for unknown reasons. It is popular among rich people and is targeted by hunters for its jewel. Its relationship with Perrserker is one of mutual disdain, as Persian's refined and elegant personality clashes with Perrserker's barbaric nature.

Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot. Tauros is a male-only species. Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails. It serves as a warning to others that Tauros is about to charge with astonishing speed. Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something. Tauros are capable of smashing through large boulders when charging. It lives and travels in herds on plains and grasslands . It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns. While still ferocious, Tauros are calmer in Alola than elsewhere, likely due to the region's climate. It is believed that the practice of using Tauros as Ride Pokémon , which is done to this day, originated in Alola. In contrast, Tauros in Galar are more volatile and don't like to be ridden.",
16,Pidgey,1,40,45,40,35,35,56,"Pidgey is a small, plump-bodied avian Pokémon . It is primarily brown with a cream-colored face, underside, and flight feathers.

It has antennae with bulbous tips where its ears should be, two long tufts of fur on top of its head, small eyes, and two large fangs in its upper jaw. It is covered in yellow fur with many black stripes. There is a large, lightning bolt-shaped stripe on Electabuzz's chest, a V-shaped stripe on its forehead, one stripe on its side, a thick stripe down its back, two bands on each leg, several broken bands on each arm, and many rings around its long tail. There are three clawed toes on each of its feet, two in front and one in back, and five fingers on each hand. In the dark, Electabuzz will glow light blue from the electrical charges running across its body. It is constantly leaking more electricity than it consumes. Being near an Electabuzz will cause a human's hair to stand on end. Electabuzz often gathered groups around tall trees to wait for the upcoming storm. During torrential thunderstorms, Electabuzz will compete to find locations likely to be struck by lightning to absorb the electric power. Electabuzz is often used as an alternative to lightning rods because it is unharmed by the absorption of electricity. It is also capable of entirely nonverbal communication via electrical currents when near another of its species. Blackouts have been known to happen when groups of Electabuzz gather to consume electricity from power plants, they often get blamed for the occurring power outages. As a result, Ground-type Pokémon are kept around power plants to keep Electabuzz from raiding, although the blackouts are usually the fault of the electric companies, not Electabuzz. There is ongoing research on using Electabuzz to store away lightning until it is needed to be used later. As demonstrated in the Pokémon the Series episode Showdown at Dark City , Electabuzz is sent into a rage by the color red. In battle, Electabuzz windmills its arms, apparently to add momentum to its punches. This method of battle seems ineffective, as opponents can escape in the meantime.

A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell. An older Wartortle may have scars and algae growing on its shell. Poking out of the bottom of the shell is a thick, wavy tail that also has light blue fur and cannot be fully withdrawn into its shell. Its tail fur will darken with age. Its tail symbolizes longevity and good luck, making this Pokémon popular with the elderly. Because it is larger than Squirtle and has a larger shell, Wartortle has a more difficult time walking on land and keeping its balance in the water. Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail as both rudders and balancing rods to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds. Air can be stored in its fur for extended underwater diving. It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey. It's shown in the Pokémon the Series episode Beach Blank-Out Blastoise that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands. Still, its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes .

It has two large eyes with beady pupils and a gaping mouth with a gray tongue. While it lacks any visible legs, it does have two arms with three digits on each hand. Its purple sludge body contains a variety of pungent bacteria, which are so potent that it renders soil barren and incapable of supporting plant life. It is constantly oozing a bacteria-rich fluid from all parts of its body. Should it run out of internal germs, Grimer will die. Pieces of it often break off during travel and go on to become new Grimer. When combined with another Grimer, it produces new poisonous compounds. Due to its lack of a solid form, Grimer is capable of squeezing into any space or crevices with relative ease. It uses this to penetrate sewage pipes and feed off of the filthy wastewater inside. Its population fluctuates based on the availability of waste, which is Grimer's main diet. It can be found in polluted lakes and streams, as well as within cities and factories where trash and industrial waste can be found. In recent years, thanks to efforts in environmental improvements and a decrease in their food source of waste, Grimer is now facing extinction.

By flicking its tongue out, it can detect danger and the scent of prey. Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make Ekans too heavy to move or become stuck and cause them to faint. It wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest.

Yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its segmented body resemble its eyes and are meant to scare off predators. Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna ( osmeterium ) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators. Despite these features and its camouflage in green foliage, Caterpie is often preyed upon by Flying-type Pokémon. Its four tiny feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort. Caterpie is easy to capture and grows quickly, making it ideal for new Trainers . As Caterpie grow and develop over time, they will shed their skin many times before finally cocooning themselves in thick silk. It can also spit this silk to entangle foes as seen in the Pokémon the Series episode Ash Catches a Pokémon . It has a voracious appetite, driving it to eat a hundred leaves daily. It will even eat leaves bigger than itself. According to the 54th chapter of Pokémon Adventures , its favorite food is the Vermilion flower. Caterpie lives in temperate forests and jungles .

There is a small opening in the vines that reveals its eyes surrounded by a black space. The vines give Tangela a round shape, but it is unknown what it looks like without them. Its vines are covered in fine hair and are always growing. If damaged or lost, replacements are quickly grown back . There is a pair of red boot-like feet poking out from under the vines, but no visible arms. Tangela can ensnare and entangle anything that moves too close to it with its vines. The vines constantly jiggle and sway, unnerving enemies and causing a tickling sensation if ensnared. Tangela's vines will snap off easily and painlessly if the target pulls on them, so it can quickly escape. The vines of Tangela are said to have a refreshing flavor and scent. In Galar , its vines are used as herbs. Tangela has been sighted in temperate grasslands and swamps, and has been known to playfully swing on tree branches using its vines.",Tangela evolves into Tangrowth .

It has short arms that have three claws and two legs with feet that have four claws in front and one in back. The head and limbs are light brown. Golem grows bigger by shedding its skin once a year. The discarded shell immediately hardens when exposed to air, crumbling away and returning to the soil. Farmers are known to collect Golem's shells. Golem's soil is spread across fields to promote crop growth. However, it stops shedding with age and moss grows over its shell. As shown in the Bandai Pokémon Carddass Cards , Golem's shell is hollow, despite it looking like it is not. As shown in The Bridge Bike Gang , Golem can withdraw its head and limbs into its shell and roll at high speeds. It is dangerous when doing this, as it is unable to see and may crash into or run over anything in its path. To prevent it from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves are dug into the sides of the mountains to divert the rolling Golem's course. It is seldom seen in the wild, but may rarely be sighted in mountainous regions. Golem are known to detonate their own body. It uses this explosive force to jump from mountain to mountain. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Golem is known to occasionally sleep upside down.It is believed that Golem rocks itself into a deep slumber, similar to a cradle. However, there's a chance a sleeping Golem may roll into anyone nearby it, hence why it is best to stay clear of Golem while it sleeps.",Golem evolves from Graveler and is the final form of Geodude .

There is a Shellder attached to its tail. This Shellder has a gray, spiral shell with darker gray spots and small, triangular eyes near the base. There are several spikes across the surface of the Shellder, and it holds onto Slowbro with many sharp teeth. Shellder developed its spiral form in an effort to suck more sweetness out of Slowbro's tail. If its tail or the Shellder attached to it is broken off, Slowbro will revert to its unevolved form, Slowpoke . Slowbro has lost the capability to feel pain due to the Shellder's poison. While typically lazy and unintelligent, Slowbro apparently becomes inspired when the Shellder bites down on its tail. While it is capable of unleashing powerful psychic attacks, Slowbro is typically rather peaceful and usually prefers not to fight. Because it can no longer fish using its tail, it instead swims to catch its prey and allows the Shellder to feed on its leftover scraps. Slowbro tends to live near ponds, lakes, and seashores . As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Slowbro usually sleeps at the same time as the Shellder biting its tail. On occasion, it sleeps even when Shellder is still awake.","Slowbro evolves from Slowpoke and is one of its final forms, the other being Slowking ."

Originally, its face was colored black. Pokémon Stadium 's fainting animation had it disappear, leaving only its hair behind and implying that what appears to be dark-colored skin is actually just darkness. Jynx has a language that sounds similar to human speech and includes several cry patterns. However, this language has yet to be deciphered. It prefers to communicate by using dance-like movements. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing. These rhythmic movements often cause people to dance along with it. The Jynx in Alola are said to have wonderful precise movements. In certain parts of Galar , it has been feared and worshiped while being called the ""Queen of Ice"". The Jynx in Galar are said to have beautiful and delicate voices and a fanbase dedicated to them.

It has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. Its tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope. Mew has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness.

It is an incredibly adaptable species, capable of levitation and teleportation. It can use almost all known moves , regardless of their types . It has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pokémon . It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people. As seen on several occasions, it has the ability to create an orb of energy around itself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink. According to journals found in Kanto 's Pokémon Mansion , Mr. Fuji is the one who discovered Mew deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of Mew's DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of it, aiming it to be the most powerful Pokémon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pokémon Mewtwo . Since Mew can make itself invisible, very few people have seen it , leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of it are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though it's rarely seen, it will willingly show itself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see it.",

The mushrooms can be removed at any time and grow from spores that are doused on this Pokémon's back at birth by the mushroom on its mother's back. Tochukaso are parasitic in nature, drawing their nutrients from the host Paras's body in order to grow and exerting some command over the Pokémon's actions. For example, Paras drains nutrients from tree roots due to commands from the mushrooms. The mushrooms are also popular among collectors and have medicinal uses, usually involving extended life. Prior to Generation III , Spore was its signature move . Paras can often be found in caves ; however, it can also thrive in damp forests . In the Alola region , the mushrooms on its back do not grow well. This is thought to be from a lack of moisture or nutrients.",Paras evolves into Parasect .

Hitmonlee is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart. Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring (and one particular Hitmonlee can do this with its arms as well). The source of its power comes from the ligaments in its legs that Hitmonlee can fully control. This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides, giving it greater reach for its kicks. Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position. Hitmonlee's kicking strength is incredibly powerful owing to its diamond-like soles. Right before kicking an opponent, Hitmonlee will harden the muscles on the sole of its foot, allowing it to maximize the full power of its kick. It has sometimes been nicknamed the ""Kick Master"". After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles. Rarely found in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas . It has been seen competing with either Hitmonchan , or Hitmontop .

Dratini's life energy is constantly building so it is always growing, and can reach lengths of over six feet (2 meters). As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly; it hides behind a rapid waterfall during the process to protect itself, since the new skin is soft in texture. The shed skin can be tanned and used to create luxury boots. Dratini has been referred as the ""Mirage Pokémon"", because its existence was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth. Dratini was first discovered by a fisherman who spent 10 hours attempting to capture it. A small colony has also been found underwater, further confirming its existence. Dratini live near or in bodies of water with a rapid flow, such as the pools at the bottom of waterfalls. It lives a quiet life underwater, eating any food that sinks down to the bottom. As mentioned in Pokémon Sleep , Dratini's sleeping habits used to be a mystery due to how rare it was.However, in recent years, Dratini's sleep styles have been discovered and well documented.

On its head, Cubone wears the skull of its dead mother as a helmet. Because of this, much of its actual face has never been seen, except for its triangular, black (sometimes green or blue) eyes and a small area surrounding them, and in its Bandai Namco card a bit of its mouth, where it has a pair of a few sharp teeth and a long pink tongue. The skull has two rounded horns on the top of its head and a tooth-like point on the lower sides. Under the skull, Cubone has a brown snout. This small Pokémon survives only through the immense skill it possesses in wielding the bone it carries as a weapon. It is called the Lonely Pokémon because of its tendency to keep to itself and avoid social situations, due to the trauma caused by the death of its Marowak mother. Cubone is said to have lost its mother shortly after being born. Cubone will often weep at night in mourning of its mother. When Cubone cries, the skull that it wears on its head vibrates and emits ""a plaintive and mournful sound."" On the night of a full moon, the cries are said to be especially terrible. Cubone seems to recognize a likeness of its mother in the full moon, and so it howls with a particular sadness.

It is stated to be capable of passing unscathed through streams of magma (3,600 degrees Fahrenheit) and withstanding a direct blow from a cannonball without being harmed. However, because of this tough hide, it is insensitive. Despite its well-developed brain, it can be forgetful. Rhydon lives in rough terrain like in caves or on top of mountains.

Sticky, smelly saliva coats its tongue, which causes a tingling sensation when touched and can cause rashes if not cleaned off. It is used for capturing prey (mainly Bug-type Pokémon), reaching for berries , exploring its environment, attacking, and cleaning; although the effectiveness of its cleaning is questionable as its saliva leaves behind its smell. Lickitung's saliva can also be used as a strong adhesive after cooking it. Lickitung remembers things by their texture and taste, although it apparently dislikes sour things.

Two large wings with blue-green undersides sprout from its back, and a horn-like appendage juts out from the top of the third joint of each wing. A single wing finger is visible through the center of each wing membrane. Charizard's arms are short and skinny compared to its robust belly, and each limb has three white claws. In Pokémon Red and Green Versions , Charizard is seemingly shown holding a fireball, implying that it's capable of manipulating its flames using its hands; this is seen in media where it uses Fire Punch . It has stocky legs with cream-colored soles on each of its plantigrade feet. The tip of its long, tapering tail burns with a sizable flame, which can intensify to a blue flame if Charizard is irritated. Charizard flies in search of powerful opponents to battle, and its fire will burn hotter as it gains experience. Its fiery breath can melt boulders and massive glaciers and has been known to cause forest fires accidentally. Though its fiery breath is hot, it never turns it on any opponent weaker than itself. In the Pokémon the Series: Gold and Silver episode Charizard's Burning Ambitions , it is established that only a weak Charizard would show off its power. Its wings can carry it to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters), but An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS notes that its droppings were found on Mt. Fuji , implying it could fly thrice as high. In the Pokémon the Series: The Beginning episode Charizard Chills , it was shown that Charizard is vulnerable to having its tail flame going out in the same way as Charmander , as Ash Ketchum warns his Charizard to not let its flame go out. However, the side story episode Those Darn Electabuzz! showed that Charizard can swim underwater, with Pokémon Origins further showing that the flame on the tip of the tail can still keep burning underwater. Charizard typically inhabits mountains and valleys , such as the Charicific Valley in Johto . However, Charizard can also live in volcanoes, forming packs with other members of its family, including Charmander . In Pokémon Snap , it's shown that Charizard is fully capable of living inside lava within volcanic craters. In Pokémon Sleep , as well as media like the animated series , Charizard is known to sleep in an incredibly relaxed position, as it is very confident in its power. A Charizard sleeping flat on its back may be an indicator of that Charizard being especially strong. Even though Charizard originally couldn't learn the move Fly , Pokémon Trainers have been shown riding Charizard in official artwork dating back to the 1997 Carddass Trading Cards . Ash himself was shown riding his Charizard already in the second season of the original series of Pokémon the Series . Eventually, in Pokémon Yellow , Charizard became able to learn Fly and has since been frequently depicted as a Pokémon able to carry people on its back to fly them to distant areas.

A black and white swirl covers its belly, which is actually its organs showing through its thin skin. It appears to have white gloves on its hands and rounded, digit-less feet. When out of water, it sweats to keep its skin moist and healthy. This keeps it covered in an oily fluid that allows it to slip away from enemies. All of its skin feels this way except where its swirl is, which is instead very smooth. The swirl on its belly undulates slowly and staring at it induces drowsiness. Even though Poliwhirl is capable of moving on land, it prefers to stay in freshwater ponds and lakes where it has fewer natural enemies. It feeds on both bug and fish Pokémon. While it will leave the water to capture bug Pokémon, it will return and consume them underwater in safety. Its swirl is used to make children fall asleep. Poliwhirl's sweat is filled with slimy mucus. When captured by an enemy, it either slithers to escape or use its swirl to put the enemy to sleep.",Poliwhirl evolves from Poliwag and evolves into either Poliwrath or Politoed .

Nidoqueen is a female-only species. As stated in An Illustrated Book of POCKET MONSTERS , it cannot lay Eggs as it loses the ability to do so upon Evolution . Nidoqueen can be quite fierce and is very protective of its young. This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young, and it will try to seal the entrance to its burrow to protect them. It also places its young in the gaps between the spines on its back, which never release poison when the children are present. Nidoqueen is more adept at being defensive than offensive. Nidoqueen's armor-like scales allow it to defend its children from any attack. When in contact with foes, it can poison them with the spikes on its back or cause small tremors by slamming the ground. It is also adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles, and it uses its hefty bulk to execute powerful moves. Being the result of an Evolution via Evolution stone , Nidoqueen is rarely found in the wild. However, they can be found in savannas and plains .",Nidoqueen evolves from Nidorina and is the final form of Nidoran♀ .
